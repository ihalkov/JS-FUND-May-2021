// 3. ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Units)
// 4. Registers, RAM
// 5. CPU - Instruction Cycle

// 1. Early Computing
    // the punched card
        // piece off stiff paper that can be used to contain digital data
        // represented by the presence or absence of holes in predefined positions
        // like CD or DVD Disks, they have small holes made with laser
    // widely used through mush of 20th century in the data processing industry

    // Transistors
        // control the electrical signals (pipe with water)
        // computers are working with collection of transistors
        
// 2. Boolean logic
    // input one and input two => output
    // NOT !(reverse the logic) (true/false)
    // AND && (two inputs have to be true) returns one element
    // OR || (one of them to be true)
    // XOR ^ (two diff inputs have true) (same inputs, false result)

    // the electricity is going through the way of less resistance

    // Logic Gates
    // XOR is used in cryptography

// 3. ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Units)
    // two inputs, two outputs (sum, carry)
    // half adder
    // full adder (3 inputs, 2 outputs)

    // division is more slower operation than (sum, subs and multiplication)

// 4. Registers, RAM
    // Gated Latch
    // circuit that has two stable states and can be used to store state information
    // it has a third input that must be active for the SET and RESET inputs to take effect
    // this third input is sometimes called ENABLE because it enables the operation of the SET and RESET inputs
    // all operations on one cycle, 3 gHz

    // RAM stores data and machine code currently being used
        // allow data items to be read or written

// 5. CPU and Instruction cycle
    // carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic,
    // logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations
    // has personal memory
    // 4-bit opcode
    // CPU takes instructions from RAM
        // Fetch Phase
        // instruction register
